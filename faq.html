     <p class="p_faq">
     <span class="header_faq">What type of payments do you support ?</span> &nbsp; <br />
          I accept payments via Western Union and UnionPay. In case of UnionPay you simply put money on my card - Merchants Bank or <br />China Construction Bank. If you live in China, you might consider using UnionPay, as there will be no fee for the transfer.
     </p>
     <p class="p_faq_odd">
     <span class="header_faq">How to order a product ?</span> &nbsp; <br />
          There are two ways to order a product:
          1) write me a letter to <a href="mailto:info@shopinchina.co">info@shopinchina.co</a> with the description of the item you're looking for. Try to be as specific, as you can. Remember to send me a picture if you have one.
          2) you can fill the form on the <a href="index.html">main page</a>. Again, try to be as specific, as you can. It will speed up the whole process.
          After you receive my letter with pricing, you tell me your address and make a money transfer, then I buy the stuff and send it to you.
     </p>
     <p class="p_faq">
        <span class="header_faq">Which delivery services do you use ?</span> &nbsp; <br />
          I send products using <b>China Post</b> or <b>EMS</b> (30% discount in case of EMS).
     </p>
     <p class="p_faq_odd"> 
        <span class="header_faq">What is the fee for your service ?</span> &nbsp;  <br />
        It depends on the amount of stuff you want to buy. The more you buy, the more discount you have.
        I charge 10% of the product price, if the total sum of the order is less then 1000 RMB.<br />
        I charge 8% if your order is more than 1000 RMB.<br />
      </p>
     <p class="p_faq_odd">
        <span class="header_faq">Why don't you use PayPal ?</span> &nbsp; <br />
        I used to use it, but its work is unstable in China. Often PayPal accounts in China are locked, so I decided to stay with Western Union for a while, though I will do my best
        to make it work and provide ability to pay with PayPal.
     </p>
     <p class="p_faq">
        <span class="header_faq">How much does it take to receive the goods ?</span> &nbsp; <br />
        Normally it's 2-3 weeks starting from the date you make the cash transfer.
     </p>
     <p class="p_faq_odd">
        <span class="header_faq">Which kind of products can you send to me ?</span> &nbsp; <br />
        I can send you clothes and all kind of stuff, yet one should be cautious with expensive items or electronic devices. For example, I wouldn't send an iPad to Russia, as it might cause problems at the customs.
     </p>
      <p class="p_faq">
        <span class="header_faq">Is it possible to return the goods ?</span> &nbsp; <br />
        No, it's not. The reason for that is that the whole process would take too much time and money. Besides, even when the Chinese supplier provides, say, a 7 days return policy, this time woun't be enough: couple of days for me to buy an item, a week or two for you to get the item, the same time for me to get it in case if you want to send it back, and some time for me to send the item back to the supplier. In fact, I check myself all the products I send, so I can guarantee the quality.
      </p>
      <p class="p_faq_odd">
        <span class="header_faq">Do you provide money return ?</span> &nbsp; <br />
        No, I don't. As there's no possibility to return an item, there is no necessity to provide this function. Though, I value my reputation and my clients, so if an issue occurs I might consider refunding. 
      </p>
      <p class="p_faq">
        <span class="header_faq">Why should I believe you ?</span> &nbsp; <br />
           You simply have no other option (or you might as well consider leaving this site). Just keep in mind that I care about my reputation and my clients, so I want to do my job well and let everybody be happy and benefiting.
